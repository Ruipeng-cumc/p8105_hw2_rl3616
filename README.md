# Course Projects – Data Science in Public Health (R, tidyverse)

### Integrated multi-source time-series data   
from **FiveThirtyEight political polls**, S&P 500 index, and U.S. unemployment statistics by parsing and standardizing date fields, recoding party indicators, reshaping wide unemployment tables to long format, and performing key-based joins on year–month using R (tidyverse).

### Cleaned and combined messy Excel data  
from the **“Mr. Trash Wheel” environmental project** by selecting valid observation rows, harmonizing variable names and types (including converting rounded counts to integers), adding source identifiers, and stacking multiple sheets (Mr., Professor, and Gwynnda Trash Wheel) into a single tidy dataset used for summary statistics and inline reporting.

### Built a tidy NYC rental price panel  
by importing **Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI)** data and **ZIP–borough–neighborhood crosswalks**, reconciling borough/county naming inconsistencies, checking for completeness, merging sources, and analyzing COVID-era rent changes (e.g., ranking ZIP codes by largest price drop from January 2020 to January 2021).
